You can upload using one of these methods:

#### Option A: Xcode (Recommended)

2. Select Product → Archive
3. Use the Organizer to upload to App Store Connect

```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app --file ios/build/ios/spiral_journal.ipa --type ios \

  --password "your-app-specific-password"
```

#### Option C: Transporter App
1. Download Apple's Transporter app
2. Drag and drop the IPA file
3. Sign in and upload

### 4. TestFlight Configuration
Once uploaded:
1. Wait for processing to complete (usually 10-30 minutes)
