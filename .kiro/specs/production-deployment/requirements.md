# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spiral Journal Flutter app currently exists as a beautiful Material Design 3 prototype with static data and dummy content. To transform this into a production-ready AI-powered personal growth platform, we need to implement data persistence, AI integration, user authentication, and deployment infrastructure. This feature encompasses all the technical and functional requirements needed to launch a fully functional journaling app that users can download, use, and rely on for their personal growth journey.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely create an account and log in, so that my journal entries are private and accessible only to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user opens the app THEN the system SHALL present authentication screens for sign up and login
2. WHEN a user provides valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with encrypted credentials
3. WHEN a user logs in with correct credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and provide access to their personal journal
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and require re-authentication
5. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password reset mechanism

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my journal entries to be permanently saved and synchronized across devices, so that I never lose my personal reflections and can access them anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes a journal entry THEN the system SHALL save it to persistent cloud storage
2. WHEN a user creates an entry on one device THEN the system SHALL synchronize it to all their other devices
3. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL save entries locally and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN a user deletes an entry THEN the system SHALL remove it from all devices and cloud storage
5. IF the app crashes or closes unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved content in draft form

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI analysis of my journal entries to provide insights about my emotional patterns and personal growth, so that I can better understand myself and track my development over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a journal entry THEN the system SHALL analyze it using Claude AI for emotional intelligence insights
2. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL update the user's personality cores with new data
3. WHEN a user views their emotional mirror THEN the system SHALL display real-time analysis based on their actual entries
4. WHEN a user has multiple entries THEN the system SHALL identify patterns and trends in their emotional journey
5. IF AI analysis fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and allow manual mood selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through my journal history and filter by moods, dates, and content, so that I can easily find specific entries and track my emotional patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses journal history THEN the system SHALL display all their entries organized by date
2. WHEN a user searches for text THEN the system SHALL return entries containing that content
3. WHEN a user filters by mood THEN the system SHALL show only entries with matching emotional states
4. WHEN a user selects a date range THEN the system SHALL display entries from that specific period
5. WHEN a user views monthly summaries THEN the system SHALL show aggregated insights and dominant moods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably on my device with good performance and offline capabilities, so that I can journal anytime without technical barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard devices
2. WHEN a user writes an entry THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, responsive text input without lag
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL allow full journaling functionality with local storage
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle sync delays and show appropriate status
5. IF the app encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log it for debugging and show user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive gentle reminders to journal and track my progress, so that I can maintain consistent journaling habits for better personal growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets up the app THEN the system SHALL allow them to configure journaling reminder preferences
2. WHEN it's time for a reminder THEN the system SHALL send a gentle notification encouraging journaling
3. WHEN a user maintains a journaling streak THEN the system SHALL acknowledge and celebrate their consistency
4. WHEN a user views their progress THEN the system SHALL show journaling frequency and growth metrics
5. IF a user hasn't journaled in a while THEN the system SHALL send encouraging check-in notifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and private, with the ability to export or delete my information, so that I have full control over my personal journal content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it both in transit and at rest
2. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide their complete journal in a standard format
3. WHEN a user wants to delete their account THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all their data from all systems
4. WHEN AI analysis occurs THEN the system SHALL process data securely without storing it in AI service logs
5. IF there's a data breach attempt THEN the system SHALL have security measures to protect user information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an app administrator, I want to deploy and monitor the app in production, so that users have a reliable service and I can maintain system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN the system SHALL be available through official app stores
2. WHEN users encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide crash reporting and error logging
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN updates are released THEN the system SHALL support seamless app updates without data loss
5. IF there are service outages THEN the system SHALL have monitori
