# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spiral Journal app has grown in complexity with multiple features including authentication, data persistence, AI integration, and cross-platform support. As the codebase expands, systematic bug tracking and resolution becomes critical to maintain app stability, user experience, and data integrity. This feature encompasses identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, and resolving bugs across all app components while establishing processes to prevent future issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically identify and catalog existing bugs in the codebase, so that I can prioritize fixes based on severity and user impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting code analysis THEN the system SHALL identify potential null pointer exceptions and unhandled error states
2. WHEN reviewing database operations THEN the system SHALL identify potential data corruption or loss scenarios
3. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL identify security vulnerabilities and edge cases
4. WHEN analyzing UI components THEN the system SHALL identify layout issues, accessibility problems, and performance bottlenecks
5. IF memory leaks or resource management issues exist THEN the system SHALL identify and document them for resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to categorize bugs by severity and component, so that I can allocate development resources effectively and address critical issues first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bug is identified THEN the system SHALL classify it as Critical, High, Medium, or Low severity
2. WHEN categorizing bugs THEN the system SHALL assign them to specific components (UI, Database, Authentication, AI, etc.)
3. WHEN prioritizing fixes THEN the system SHALL consider user impact, data safety, and app stability
4. WHEN tracking bugs THEN the system SHALL maintain clear documentation of reproduction steps and expected behavior
5. IF bugs affect data integrity or security THEN the system SHALL mark them as Critical priority

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive error handling throughout the app, so that users experience graceful failures instead of crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly messages
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic and offline fallbacks
3. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic functionality without crashing
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and recovery options
5. IF unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while maintaining app stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix data persistence and synchronization bugs, so that users never lose their journal entries or experience data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving journal entries THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent corruption
2. WHEN the app crashes during save operations THEN the system SHALL recover unsaved data or maintain data consistency
3. WHEN database migrations occur THEN the system SHALL preserve existing user data without loss
4. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions and data conflicts
5. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve authentication and security bugs, so that user data remains protected and access control works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases including first launch, biometric failures, and password changes
2. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL ensure proper encryption and secure storage practices
3. WHEN handling authentication state THEN the system SHALL prevent unauthorized access and session management issues
4. WHEN biometric authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms
5. IF security vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL patch them immediately and audit related code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix UI/UX bugs and improve accessibility, so that all users can interact with the app effectively regardless of their abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL respond consistently across different screen sizes and orientations
2. WHEN users navigate the app THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management and keyboard navigation
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios and text scaling support
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL respect system accessibility preferences and reduce motion settings
5. IF layout issues occur THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and prevent content from being inaccessible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive testing and monitoring, so that bugs are caught early and system health is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL run automated tests to catch regressions
2. WHEN the app runs in production THEN the system SHALL monitor for crashes and performance issues
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and analysis
4. WHEN testing new features THEN the system SHALL include edge cases and error scenarios
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert developers and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish bug prevention processes, so that future development maintains code quality and reduces the introduction of new bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new code THEN the system SHALL follow established coding standards and best practices
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL check for common bug patterns and security issues
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and edge case testing
4. WHEN modifying existing code THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility and data migration safety
5. IF breaking changes are introduced THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths and user communication
