# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that every time the app is launched via `flutter run`, it behaves as if it's a fresh installation from the app store. Users will experience the complete onboarding flow (splash screen → onboarding → profile creation → journal screen) every time, simulating the real production experience without any persisted data or state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to reset to a fresh state on every launch, so that I can test the complete user onboarding experience consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is launched via `flutter run` THEN the system SHALL clear all existing user data and preferences
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL display the splash screen as the first screen
3. WHEN the splash screen completes THEN the system SHALL navigate to the onboarding flow
4. WHEN onboarding is completed THEN the system SHALL navigate to profile creation
5. WHEN profile creation is completed THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main journal screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all user data to be cleared on app launch, so that each run simulates a first-time user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL clear all database entries
2. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL clear all shared preferences
3. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL clear all secure storage data
4. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL reset all user settings to defaults
5. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL clear any cached AI analysis data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the complete onboarding flow to be mandatory on every launch, so that I can verify the user experience is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL NOT skip any onboarding steps
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL NOT auto-navigate to previously visited screens
3. WHEN the user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL require profile setup
4. WHEN the user completes profile setup THEN the system SHALL navigate to the journal screen
5. IF the user tries to navigate backwards during onboarding THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation to maintain the flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want this fresh install mode to be easily toggleable in system settings, so that I can switch between development and production testing modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in fresh install mode THEN the system SHALL display a subtle indicator in the UI
2. WHEN fresh install mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log the data clearing process for debugging
3. WHEN fresh install mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL behave with normal data persistence
4. IF there are any errors during data clearing THEN the system SHALL log them and continue with the fresh install flow
5. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL determine the mode based on a configuration flag

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fresh install experience to match the production app behavior exactly, so that testing is representative of real user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splash screen displays THEN the system SHALL show the same branding and timing as production
2. WHEN onboarding runs THEN the system SHALL display all slides and interactions as in production
3. WHEN profile creation runs THEN the system SHALL require all mandatory fields as in production
4. WHEN the journal screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the empty state as a new user would see
5. WHEN any screen transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use the same animations and timing as production
