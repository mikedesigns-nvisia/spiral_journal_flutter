# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Integration Enhancement feature addresses the current disconnection between the "Your Cores" widget on the journal screen and the "Core Library" screen in the insights tab. Currently, these two components operate independently with different data sources and no contextual connection, creating a fragmented user experience. This enhancement will unify the core system to provide a seamless, connected experience that clearly shows how journaling impacts personal growth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent core data across all screens so that my progress is accurately reflected everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view cores in the journal screen THEN the data SHALL be identical to what I see in the core library screen
2. WHEN core data is updated through AI analysis THEN both the Your Cores widget and Core Library screen SHALL reflect the changes immediately
3. WHEN I refresh either screen THEN both screens SHALL show synchronized data from the same source
4. IF there is a data loading error THEN both screens SHALL show consistent error states
5. WHEN cores are updated THEN the changes SHALL persist across app sessions

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Navigation and Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly navigate from the core summary to detailed views with relevant context preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap "Explore All" in Your Cores widget THEN I SHALL navigate to the Core Library with smooth transition
2. WHEN I tap on a specific core in Your Cores widget THEN I SHALL navigate directly to that core's detail view
3. WHEN I navigate from journal to core details THEN the navigation SHALL include context about recent journal impact
4. WHEN I return from core details THEN I SHALL return to the previous screen with state preserved
5. WHEN I navigate between core views THEN the transition SHALL be visually smooth and contextually aware

### Requirement 3: Journal-Core Connection Visibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see how my journal entries are affecting my core development so I understand the connection between writing and growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view core details THEN I SHALL see how recent journal entries have influenced that core
2. WHEN a core changes after journaling THEN I SHALL see a visual indicator of the change
3. WHEN I view Your Cores widget THEN I SHALL see recent impact indicators from my latest journal entry
4. WHEN I complete AI analysis THEN I SHALL see real-time updates to affected cores
5. WHEN I view core trends THEN I SHALL see correlation with my journaling frequency and content themes

### Requirement 4: Real-time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want all core displays to update immediately when changes occur so I see my progress in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN all core displays SHALL update within 2 seconds
2. WHEN I save a journal entry THEN core progress indicators SHALL reflect any immediate changes
3. WHEN cores are updated in the background THEN all visible core widgets SHALL refresh automatically
4. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN core data SHALL be current without manual refresh
5. WHEN multiple screens show cores THEN they SHALL all display identical, synchronized data

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Core Detail Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want rich, contextual core details that show my personal journey and provide actionable insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a core detail THEN I SHALL see my personal journey timeline with journal entry connections
2. WHEN I view core insights THEN I SHALL see personalized recommendations based on my recent writing patterns
3. WHEN I view core milestones THEN I SHALL see which journal entries contributed to achieving them
4. WHEN I view core trends THEN I SHALL see visual connections to my emotional patterns from journaling
5. WHEN I interact with core details THEN I SHALL have options to take action (journal prompts, reflection questions)

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want core data to load quickly and reliably across all screens without delays or inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open any screen with cores THEN the data SHALL load within 1 second on typical devices
2. WHEN core data is cached THEN it SHALL be used to provide immediate display while fresh data loads
3. WHEN there are network issues THEN core displays SHALL gracefully handle offline states
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded and resumed THEN core data SHALL be refreshed appropriately
5. WHEN multiple core operations occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL not conflict or cause data corruption

### Requirement 7: Visual Consistency and Polish

**User Story:** As a user, I want all core displays to have consistent visual design and smooth interactions that feel like part of a unified system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view cores in different locations THEN they SHALL use consistent visual design language
2. WHEN cores update THEN the changes SHALL be animated smoothly to show the progression
3. WHEN I interact with core elements THEN they SHALL provide appropriate haptic and visual feedback
4. WHEN cores are loading THEN they SHALL show consistent, branded loading states
5. WHEN I view core colors and icons THEN they SHALL be consistent across all displays and match the design system

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want core features to be fully accessible and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use screen readers THEN all core information SHALL be properly announced with context
2. WHEN I navigate with keyboard or switch control THEN all core interactions SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN I use high contrast mode THEN core displays SHALL remain clearly visible and usable
4. WHEN I use large text sizes THEN core layouts SHALL adapt appropriately without losing functionality
5. WHEN I have motor difficulties THEN core tap targets SHALL be appropriately sized and spaced
