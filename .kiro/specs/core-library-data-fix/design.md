# Design Document: Core Library Data Fix

## Overview

The Core Library feature in Spiral Journal is currently not receiving data from journal entries, preventing users from seeing their emotional core progress. Additionally, the icon colors need to be modeled consistently with the emotional mirror UI. This design document outlines the approach to fix these issues and ensure proper data flow from journal entries to the Core Library.

## Architecture

The Core Library feature relies on several interconnected components:

1. **Journal Entry Processing**: When users create journal entries, the `JournalProvider` should queue entries for analysis.
2. **Emotional Analysis**: The `EmotionalAnalyzer` processes entries to extract emotional patterns and insights.
3. **Core Evolution**: The `CoreEvolutionEngine` calculates how cores should evolve based on analysis results.
4. **Core Storage**: The `CoreLibraryService` manages core data persistence using SharedPreferences.
5. **Core Display**: The `CoreLibraryScreen` displays the core data to users.

The current issue appears to be a disconnection in this pipeline, where journal entries are not properly triggering core updates, or updated cores are not being persisted correctly.

## Components and Interfaces

### Journal Analysis Service

The `JournalAnalysisService` orchestrates the analysis of journal entries and updates to emotional cores. We need to ensure that:

1. The `analyzeJournalEntry` method is being called when new entries are created
2. The resulting `updatedCores` are being properly passed to the `CoreLibraryService`
3. The `CoreLibraryService` is correctly saving these updates to SharedPreferences

### Core Library Service

The `CoreLibraryService` manages the persistence and retrieval of core data. We need to:

1. Fix the `updateCoresWithJournalAnalysis` method to properly process and store core updates
2. Ensure the `getAllCores` method correctly retrieves the most recent core data
3. Add proper error handling and logging to identify any persistence issues

### Core Library Screen

The `CoreLibraryScreen` displays core data to users. We need to:

1. Update the color handling to match the emotional mirror UI
2. Ensure consistent color parsing from hex strings
3. Apply consistent opacity and styling to core icons and progress indicators

## Data Models

The core data model is defined in `lib/models/core.dart` and includes:

```dart
class EmotionalCore {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String description;
  final double currentLevel; // 0.0 to 1.0
  final double previousLevel;
  final DateTime lastUpdated;
  final String trend; // 'rising', 'stable', 'declining'
  final String color;
  final String iconPath;
  final String insight;
  final List<String> relatedCores;
  final List<CoreMilestone> milestones;
  final List<CoreInsight> recentInsights;
  
  // Methods and constructors...
}
```

No changes to the data model are required, but we need to ensure proper serialization and deserialization when storing and retrieving core data.

## Error Handling

We need to improve error handling in the core update pipeline:

1. Add specific error logging in the `CoreLibraryService` to identify persistence issues
2. Implement graceful fallbacks when core data cannot be retrieved
3. Add validation to ensure core data is properly formatted before storage
4. Implement retry mechanisms for failed core updates

## Testing Strategy

To verify the fixes, we will:

1. Create unit tests for the `CoreLibraryService` to verify proper data persistence
2. Create integration tests that simulate journal entry creation and verify core updates
3. Test the UI with various color configurations to ensure consistent rendering
4. Test edge cases like first-time users and users with many journal entries

## Implementation Plan

### Fix Data Flow from Journal Entries to Core Library

1. Update the `JournalProvider` to properly queue entries for analysis
2. Ensure the `JournalAnalysisService` is correctly processing entries and updating cores
3. Fix the `CoreLibraryService` to properly store updated cores in SharedPreferences
4. Add logging to track the core update pipeline

### Fix Color Modeling in Core Library UI

1. Update the `_getCoreColor` method in `CoreLibraryScreen` to match the emotional mirror UI
2. Ensure consistent color parsing from hex strings
3. Apply consistent opacity and styling to core icons and progress indicators
4. Test with various color configurations to ensure consistent rendering

## Potential Challenges

1. **Data Migration**: Existing users may have inconsistent or missing core data
2. **Performance**: Processing many journal entries could impact performance
3. **Concurrency**: Multiple core updates happening simultaneously could cause conflicts
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must maintain compatibility with existing data

## Conclusion

By implementing these fixes, we will ensure that the Core Library properly displays emotional core data derived from journal entries, with consistent visual styling that matches the rest of the app. This will provide users with a more cohesive and valuable experience when tracking their emotional growth.
