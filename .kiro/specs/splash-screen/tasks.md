# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create splash screen widget with basic layout and styling
  - Create `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` with StatefulWidget structure
  - Implement basic UI layout with app name, attributions, and proper spacing
  - Apply AppTheme colors and typography for consistent branding
  - Add proper padding and alignment for centered content layout
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Implement timer-based auto-dismiss functionality
  - Add Timer logic for minimum display duration (2-3 seconds)
  - Implement automatic navigation to next screen after timer completion
  - Add proper timer disposal in widget lifecycle methods
  - Handle edge cases like widget disposal during timer execution
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Add smooth fade transition animations
  - Implement AnimationController with fade-in animation for splash content
  - Add fade-out animation for smooth transition to next screen
  - Create staggered animations for different UI elements (app name, attributions)
  - Ensure animations respect system reduce-motion preferences
  - _Requirements: 4.2_

- [x] 4. Integrate splash screen into app navigation flow
  - Modify `lib/main.dart` to show SplashScreen as initial route
  - Update AuthWrapper to handle splash screen completion
  - Implement navigation logic to determine next screen (auth vs main)
  - Test complete flow: splash → auth → main screen transitions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Add optional tap-to-dismiss functionality
  - Implement GestureDetector for tap handling on splash screen
  - Add minimum display time before allowing early dismissal
  - Ensure tap-to-dismiss works smoothly with existing timer logic
  - Add visual feedback or subtle indication that screen is tappable
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive unit tests for splash screen logic
  - Write tests for timer functionality and duration handling
  - Test navigation logic and screen transition scenarios
  - Create tests for animation lifecycle and proper disposal
  - Add tests for tap-to-dismiss functionality and edge cases
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through automated testing_

- [ ] 7. Add widget tests for UI rendering and accessibility
  - Test splash screen widget rendering with correct text and styling
  - Verify proper AppTheme integration and color usage
  - Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
  - Add accessibility tests for screen reader compatibility and contrast
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Add try-catch blocks around navigation and animation code
  - Implement fallback navigation if splash screen encounters errors
  - Add proper error logging for debugging splash screen issues
  - Test error scenarios and ensure app continues to function
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_
