# Emotional Mirror UI Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

Transform the emotional mirror screen from a traditional scrolling layout to a slide-based interface where each existing container becomes its own slide. Users can swipe between containers while maintaining all current functionality and content exactly as it exists today. This creates a more focused experience where each container gets dedicated screen space without any functional changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Slide-Based Navigation System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through different emotional mirror components using smooth slide transitions, so that I can focus on one aspect of my emotional data at a time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the emotional mirror screen THEN I SHALL see a slide-based interface with smooth horizontal transitions
2. WHEN I swipe left or right THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the next/previous component
3. WHEN I use navigation indicators THEN I SHALL be able to jump directly to any specific slide
4. IF I'm on the first slide THEN swiping right SHALL have no effect with subtle bounce feedback
5. IF I'm on the last slide THEN swiping left SHALL have no effect with subtle bounce feedback
6. WHEN transitioning between slides THEN animations SHALL be smooth and responsive (60fps)

### Requirement 2: Container-to-Slide Conversion

**User Story:** As a user, I want each existing emotional mirror container to become its own slide with identical functionality, so that I can focus on one container at a time while keeping all current features intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any container slide THEN it SHALL display the exact same content and functionality as the current implementation
2. WHEN interacting with container elements THEN all existing buttons, filters, and interactions SHALL work identically
3. WHEN viewing the emotional journey timeline container THEN it SHALL occupy a full slide with no functional changes
4. WHEN viewing self-awareness evolution container THEN it SHALL display in its own slide with all current metrics
5. WHEN viewing pattern recognition container THEN it SHALL show in a dedicated slide with existing functionality
6. WHEN viewing mood overview container THEN it SHALL appear in its own slide with current visualizations
7. WHEN viewing any container THEN the layout SHALL be optimized for full-screen presentation without changing content

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Visual Design for Slides

**User Story:** As a user, I want each slide to have beautiful, cohesive visual design that makes emotional data engaging and easy to understand, so that I feel motivated to explore my emotional patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any slide THEN it SHALL use consistent Material Design 3 principles with app theming
2. WHEN slides transition THEN they SHALL maintain visual continuity with shared design elements
3. WHEN displaying data visualizations THEN they SHALL be optimized for the full slide space
4. WHEN showing text content THEN typography SHALL be clear and hierarchically organized
5. WHEN using colors THEN they SHALL follow the app's warm orange palette (#865219, #FDB876) with cream backgrounds
6. WHEN displaying cards THEN they SHALL use appropriate shadows and elevation for depth

### Requirement 4: Slide Navigation Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation controls to move between slides and understand my current position, so that I can easily explore all emotional mirror components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing slides THEN I SHALL see page indicators showing current position and total slides
2. WHEN I tap page indicators THEN I SHALL jump directly to that specific slide
3. WHEN swiping THEN I SHALL feel haptic feedback on successful transitions
4. WHEN using navigation THEN slide titles SHALL be clearly visible in headers
5. WHEN transitioning THEN loading states SHALL be smooth without jarring content shifts
6. WHEN on any slide THEN I SHALL have access to refresh functionality

### Requirement 5: Responsive Slide Layouts

**User Story:** As a user, I want slides to adapt beautifully to different screen sizes and orientations, so that the emotional mirror works perfectly on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using iPhone SE THEN slides SHALL adapt to compact screen dimensions
2. WHEN using iPhone Pro Max THEN slides SHALL utilize larger screen space effectively
3. WHEN rotating device THEN slides SHALL gracefully handle orientation changes
4. WHEN using iPad THEN slides SHALL scale appropriately for tablet viewing
5. WHEN content overflows THEN individual slides SHALL handle scrolling within their bounds
6. WHEN displaying charts THEN they SHALL resize responsively within slide constraints

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want slide transitions to be buttery smooth and data loading to be seamless, so that exploring my emotional mirror feels fluid and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swiping between slides THEN transitions SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN loading slide content THEN data SHALL be preloaded for adjacent slides
3. WHEN displaying charts THEN rendering SHALL be optimized to prevent frame drops
4. WHEN switching slides rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without lag
5. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage resources
6. WHEN network requests occur THEN they SHALL not block slide navigation

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the slide-based interface to be fully accessible and easy to navigate, so that I can use all emotional mirror features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using VoiceOver THEN slide navigation SHALL be announced clearly
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN I SHALL be able to navigate between slides
3. WHEN slides change THEN screen readers SHALL announce the new content context
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN slide designs SHALL remain clearly visible
5. WHEN using large text sizes THEN slide layouts SHALL adapt appropriately
6. WHEN using switch control THEN slide navigation SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 8: Preserved Functionality and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing emotional mirror functionality to work exactly the same in the slide format, so that I don't lose any features or have to relearn the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using filters THEN they SHALL work identically to the current implementation across all slides
2. WHEN refreshing data THEN the current refresh functionality SHALL work exactly the same
3. WHEN viewing different time ranges THEN the existing time range selector SHALL function identically
4. WHEN switching view modes THEN the current view mode functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN searching THEN the existing search functionality SHALL work across all slide content
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the current error handling SHALL be maintained
7. WHEN loading data THEN existing loading states SHALL be preserved in slide format
8. WHEN interacting with any container element THEN it SHALL behave exactly as it does currently
