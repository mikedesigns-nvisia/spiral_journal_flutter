# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spiral Journal Flutter app has several critical testing issues that are preventing proper test execution and causing failures. These issues include compilation errors, binding initialization problems, widget test failures, and chart rendering issues. This feature addresses these testing problems to ensure a robust and reliable test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to compile and run successfully, so that I can confidently validate code changes and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN all compilation errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN running flutter test THEN no compilation failures SHALL occur
3. IF there are type mismatches THEN they SHALL be fixed with proper type casting
4. WHEN performance service is used THEN Future completion checks SHALL use proper methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Flutter binding initialization to work correctly in tests, so that platform-dependent services can be tested properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require Flutter bindings THEN TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() SHALL be called
2. WHEN LocalAuthService is tested THEN binding initialization errors SHALL not occur
3. IF platform services are accessed THEN proper test setup SHALL be in place
4. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL handle binding requirements gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want widget tests to accurately test UI components, so that I can ensure the user interface works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MoodSelector widget is tested THEN it SHALL find and interact with mood chips correctly
2. WHEN mood selection occurs THEN the test SHALL properly verify selection state changes
3. IF multiple moods are selected THEN the test SHALL accurately count selected items
4. WHEN AI-detected moods are displayed THEN tests SHALL handle duplicate text elements properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want chart rendering tests to handle edge cases properly, so that data visualization components are robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EmotionalTrendChart renders single data points THEN it SHALL not produce NaN values
2. WHEN chart calculations occur THEN proper bounds checking SHALL prevent invalid coordinates
3. IF data points are insufficient for trends THEN graceful handling SHALL occur
4. WHEN chart painting happens THEN all coordinate calculations SHALL be valid

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test setup and teardown to be consistent, so that tests run reliably in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests initialize THEN proper setup SHALL occur before each test
2. WHEN tests complete THEN cleanup SHALL happen to prevent state leakage
3. IF shared resources are used THEN they SHALL be properly managed across tests
4. WHEN mock services are created THEN they SHALL be reset between test runs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling in tests, so that test failures provide clear diagnostic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL be descriptive and actionable
2. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be properly caught and reported
3. IF widget interactions fail THEN the failure reason SHALL be clear
4. WHEN assertions fail THEN the expected vs actual values SHALL be clearly shown
