The improvements ensure users with color vision deficiencies can fully understand their emotional data through both visual and textual representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the emotional balance widget displays emotion data THEN the system SHALL show text labels alongside color indicators
2. WHEN the theme switches between light and dark modes THEN the text labels SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios
3. WHEN emotions are represented visually THEN the system SHALL provide both color and text identification for each emotion
4. WHEN the widget is rendered THEN the text labels SHALL be positioned clearly and not overlap with visual elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current primary emotional state prominently displayed, so that I can quickly understand my dominant emotion at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the emotional mirror screen THEN the system SHALL display a primary emotional state widget

3. WHEN the primary emotion changes THEN the widget SHALL update to reflect the new dominant emotional state
4. WHEN no emotional data is available THEN the widget SHALL display an appropriate neutral or loading state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the primary emotional state widget to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and other assistive technologies effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary emotional state widget is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide proper semantic labels for screen readers
2. WHEN the emotional state changes THEN the system SHALL announce the change to assistive technologies
3. WHEN the widget displays emotion information THEN the system SHALL include both visual and textual descriptions
4. WHEN users navigate with keyboard or assistive devices THEN the widget SHALL be properly focusable and navigable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent emotional state representation across both light and dark themes, so that the accessibility improvements work regardless of my theme preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches between light and dark themes THEN both widgets SHALL maintain accessibility standards
2. WHEN text labels are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratios in both theme modes
3. WHEN colors are used for emotional representation THEN the system SHALL provide theme-appropriate alternatives
