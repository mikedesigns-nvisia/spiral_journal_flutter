# TestFlight Build Test Fixes - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical test failures that are preventing successful TestFlight builds. The test suite has multiple failures related to service lifecycle management, widget finding, and test timeouts that need to be resolved to ensure build stability and TestFlight deployment readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper service lifecycle management in tests, so that services are not used after disposal and tests run reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN SettingsService SHALL be properly disposed without being accessed afterward
2. WHEN tests initialize services THEN services SHALL have proper lifecycle management to prevent disposal errors
3. WHEN multiple tests run in sequence THEN service instances SHALL be properly isolated between tests
4. WHEN Provider widgets are used in tests THEN they SHALL properly manage service disposal

### Requirement 2: Test Widget Finding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to reliably find expected UI elements, so that widget tests pass consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fresh install tests run THEN "Set up your PIN" text SHALL be found in the widget tree
2. WHEN onboarding flow tests run THEN expected UI elements SHALL be present and findable
3. WHEN MaterialApp tests run THEN MaterialApp widgets SHALL be properly instantiated and findable
4. WHEN navigation tests run THEN expected screens and widgets SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 3: Test Performance and Timeouts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to complete within reasonable time limits, so that the build process doesn't hang or timeout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theme switching tests run THEN they SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL not hang indefinitely
3. WHEN multiple widget tests run THEN they SHALL have proper async handling
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN it SHALL complete efficiently without blocking

### Requirement 4: Test Isolation and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be properly isolated, so that one test's state doesn't affect another test's execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN tests initialize THEN they SHALL start with clean state
3. WHEN Provider services are used THEN they SHALL be properly scoped to individual tests
4. WHEN widget trees are built THEN they SHALL not interfere with subsequent tests
