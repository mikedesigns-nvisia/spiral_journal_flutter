# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spiral Journal app is currently failing to build due to missing color properties in the AppTheme class. This feature aims to fix these build errors by properly implementing the missing color properties and addressing the constant expression issue with accentRed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the missing color properties in the AppTheme class so that the app can build successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN it SHALL compile without errors related to missing color properties.
2. WHEN the AppTheme class is used THEN it SHALL provide access to warningColor and successColor properties.
3. WHEN PopupMenuItem is created THEN it SHALL handle the accentRed color properly in constant expressions.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure color consistency across the application so that the UI maintains a cohesive look and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new colors are added to the AppTheme THEN they SHALL follow the existing color naming conventions.
2. WHEN colors are used in the app THEN they SHALL be accessed through the AppTheme class rather than hardcoded values.
3. WHEN warning and success states are displayed THEN they SHALL use the standardized warningColor and successColor.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual feedback for warning and success states so that I can easily understand the status of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a warning state is displayed THEN the app SHALL use the standardized warningColor.
2. WHEN a success state is displayed THEN the app SHALL use the standardized successColor.
3. WHEN destructive actions are presented THEN the app SHALL use the standardized accentRed color.
