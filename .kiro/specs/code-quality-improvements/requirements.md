# Code Quality Improvements Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical code quality, consistency, and maintainability issues identified during a comprehensive codebase review. The improvements focus on standardizing coding patterns, fixing deprecated API usage, reducing technical debt, and enhancing overall code consistency across the Flutter application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Modernization and Deprecation Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use current Flutter APIs so that the application remains compatible with future Flutter versions and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deprecated APIs are identified THEN they SHALL be replaced with current equivalents
2. WHEN `Colors.withValues()` is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with `Colors.withOpacity()`
3. WHEN API changes are made THEN all affected code SHALL be updated consistently
4. WHEN deprecated API fixes are applied THEN the application SHALL compile without deprecation warnings

### Requirement 2: Theme and Styling Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent theming across all UI components so that the application has a unified visual appearance and maintainable styling code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font styling is applied THEN it SHALL use GoogleFonts consistently across all components
2. WHEN hardcoded font families are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with theme-based font definitions
3. WHEN theme colors are used THEN they SHALL reference AppTheme constants rather than inline color definitions
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL follow the established Material Design 3 patterns
5. WHEN theme changes are made THEN they SHALL be reflected consistently across all screens and widgets

### Requirement 3: Constants and Magic Number Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all magic numbers and hardcoded strings centralized as named constants so that the code is more maintainable and configuration changes are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN magic numbers are identified THEN they SHALL be extracted to named constants
2. WHEN hardcoded strings are found THEN they SHALL be moved to appropriate constant classes
3. WHEN constants are created THEN they SHALL be organized in logical groupings (UI, Database, Validation, etc.)
4. WHEN constants are defined THEN they SHALL have descriptive names and documentation
5. WHEN existing magic numbers are replaced THEN all references SHALL use the new constants

### Requirement 4: Architecture Refactoring and Single Responsibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complex classes broken down into focused, single-responsibility components so that the code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthWrapper class is analyzed THEN it SHALL be refactored into separate focused classes
2. WHEN authentication logic is extracted THEN it SHALL be moved to a dedicated AuthenticationManager
3. WHEN splash screen logic is extracted THEN it SHALL be moved to a dedicated SplashScreenController
4. WHEN initialization logic is extracted THEN it SHALL be moved to a dedicated AppInitializer
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN each class SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
6. WHEN classes are split THEN the existing functionality SHALL be preserved
7. WHEN new classes are created THEN they SHALL follow established naming and structure patterns

### Requirement 5: Error Handling Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns throughout the application so that errors are managed predictably and debugging is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling patterns are inconsistent THEN they SHALL be standardized
2. WHEN try-catch blocks are used THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns for logging and rethrowing
3. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL use the centralized ErrorHandler system
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include appropriate context and severity levels
5. WHEN error handling is standardized THEN it SHALL not break existing functionality

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Naming Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent naming conventions between Dart code and database schema so that the codebase is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database field names are inconsistent THEN they SHALL be standardized to use camelCase
2. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN migration scripts SHALL be provided
3. WHEN field naming is updated THEN all related code SHALL be updated consistently
4. WHEN naming changes are applied THEN existing data SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the updated field names

### Requirement 7: Code Documentation and Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive inline documentation so that complex code sections are easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex methods are identified THEN they SHALL have descriptive documentation comments
2. WHEN public APIs are defined THEN they SHALL include parameter and return value documentation
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL include explanatory comments
4. WHEN documentation is added THEN it SHALL follow Dart documentation standards
5. WHEN comments are written THEN they SHALL be clear, concise, and add value beyond the code itself

### Requirement 8: Testing Coverage Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for refactored components so that code changes don't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are refactored THEN corresponding tests SHALL be created or updated
2. WHEN new constants are introduced THEN they SHALL be validated in tests
3. WHEN error handling is standardized THEN error scenarios SHALL be tested
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN integration tests SHALL verify functionality
5. WHEN test coverage is improved THEN it SHALL maintain or exceed current coverage levels
