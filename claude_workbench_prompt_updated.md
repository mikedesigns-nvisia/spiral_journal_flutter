    }
  ]
}
```

## Critical Data Model Requirements:

### Core Level Values:
- **currentLevel**: 0.0 to 1.0 (decimal representation, e.g., 0.725 = 72.5%)
- **previousLevel**: Previous currentLevel value for trend calculation
- **Realistic Changes**: Adjust by 0.005-0.030 per entry (0.5-3.0 percentage points)
- **Evidence-Based**: Only increase cores that are clearly demonstrated in the entry
- **Balanced**: Not every core needs to increase; some may stay stable or slightly decline

### Trend Values:
- **"rising"**: Core showed clear growth or positive development (change > +0.005)
- **"stable"**: Core maintained current level, no significant change (Â±0.005)
- **"declining"**: Core showed temporary setback or needs attention (change < -0.005)

### Timestamp Format:
- **lastUpdated**: ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., "2025-01-18T12:00:00.000Z")

### Emotional Analysis Scales:
- **emotional_intensity**: 0.0-1.0 scale (will be converted to 0-10 internally)
- **overall_sentiment**: -1.0 to 1.0 scale (-1 = very negative, 1 = very positive)

### Pattern Types:
- **"growth"**: Positive development pattern
- **"recurring"**: Repeated behavioral pattern
- **"awareness"**: Increased self-understanding pattern

## Core Impact Analysis Guidelines:

### Look for Core Indicators:
- **Optimism**: Positive language, hope for future, gratitude, silver linings, "looking forward"
- **Resilience**: Overcoming challenges, adapting to change, emotional recovery, "bouncing back"
- **Self-Awareness**: Emotional recognition, self-reflection, mindfulness, "I realized", "I noticed"
- **Creativity**: Novel solutions, artistic expression, innovative thinking, "new approach", "creative"
- **Social Connection**: Relationships, empathy, community involvement, "connected with", "understood"
- **Growth Mindset**: Learning from mistakes, embracing challenges, curiosity, "learned", "grew"

### Core Synergy Effects:
Consider how cores influence each other:
- Strong **Optimism** + **Resilience** = Enhanced emotional stability
- High **Self-Awareness** + **Growth Mindset** = Accelerated personal development
- **Creativity** + **Social Connection** = Inspiring leadership qualities

### Realistic Core Evolution:
- **Daily Changes**: Small, incremental changes (0.5-3.0 percentage points)
- **Natural Decay**: Cores naturally drift toward baseline without reinforcement
- **Milestone Awareness**: Consider 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% as significant thresholds
- **Trend Consistency**: Maintain logical trend progression over time

## Advanced Analysis Features:

### Emotional Pattern Recognition:
- **Mood Frequency**: Track recurring emotional states
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identify time-based emotional cycles
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze writing style and length patterns
- **Intensity Tracking**: Monitor emotional intensity over time

### Growth Indicators:
- **Self-Reflection**: Evidence of introspective thinking
- **Challenge Navigation**: How user handles difficulties
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Social interaction patterns
- **Learning Orientation**: Openness to new experiences

### Validation and Quality Control:
- **Validation Score**: 0.0-1.0 confidence in analysis quality
- **Content Sanitization**: Remove harmful or inappropriate content
- **Realistic Bounds**: Ensure all values stay within valid ranges
- **Consistency Checks**: Maintain logical relationships between data points

## Example Analysis:
