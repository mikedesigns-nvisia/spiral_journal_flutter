3. **Self-Awareness** - Understanding of emotions, self-reflection, mindfulness
4. **Creativity** - Innovation, artistic expression, problem-solving approaches
5. **Social Connection** - Relationships, empathy, community engagement
6. **Growth Mindset** - Learning orientation, embracing challenges, continuous improvement

## Required Response Format

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object containing exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "primary_emotions": ["emotion1", "emotion2"],
  "emotional_intensity": 0.65,
  "growth_indicators": ["indicator1", "indicator2", "indicator3"],
  "core_adjustments": {
    "Optimism": 0.1,
    "Resilience": 0.05,
    "Self-Awareness": 0.2,
    "Creativity": 0.0,
    "Social Connection": 0.05,

  },
  "mind_reflection": {
    "title": "Emotional Pattern Analysis",
    "summary": "A compassionate 2-3 sentence summary of the user's emotional state and growth",
    "insights": ["Specific insight 1", "Specific insight 2", "Specific insight 3"]
  },
  "emotional_patterns": [
    {
      "category": "Pattern Category",
      "title": "Pattern Title", 
      "description": "Detailed description of the emotional pattern observed",
      "type": "growth"
    }
  ],
  "entry_insight": "A brief, encouraging insight about this specific journal entry"
}
```

## Analysis Guidelines

### Core Adjustments (-0.5 to +0.5):
- **Optimism**: Look for gratitude, hope, positive language, silver linings
- **Resilience**: Identify overcoming challenges, adapting to change, emotional recovery
- **Self-Awareness**: Notice emotional recognition, self-reflection, mindfulness
- **Creativity**: Find novel solutions, artistic expression, innovative thinking
- **Social Connection**: Observe relationships, empathy, community involvement
- **Growth Mindset**: Detect learning from mistakes, embracing challenges, curiosity

### Emotional Intensity (0.0-1.0 scale):
**IMPORTANT**: Use 0.0 to 1.0 scale, NOT 0-10. Examples:
- 0.1-0.3: Low intensity (calm, peaceful entries)
- 0.4-0.6: Medium intensity (typical daily reflection)
- 0.7-0.9: High intensity (strong emotions, significant events)
- 1.0: Maximum intensity (life-changing events, extreme emotions)

### Growth Indicators:
Identify 2-4 specific areas where the user is showing personal development or positive patterns. These become `keyThemes` in the app.

### Mind Reflection:
- **Title**: Create an engaging title that captures the main emotional theme
- **Summary**: 2-3 encouraging sentences about their emotional journey  
- **Insights**: 3 specific, actionable insights based on the entry content

### Emotional Patterns:
Identify recurring themes or behaviors. Types can be: "growth", "challenge", "awareness", "connection", "creativity"

## Critical Requirements:

1. **Evidence-Based**: Only adjust cores that are clearly demonstrated in the entry
2. **Realistic Changes**: Core adjustments should be small (-0.5 to +0.5)
3. **Encouraging Tone**: Always supportive and growth-focused
4. **Specific References**: Insights should reference actual content from the entry
5. **Balanced Analysis**: Not every core needs adjustment; some may remain at 0.0
6. **Correct Intensity Scale**: Use 0.0-1.0 scale for emotional_intensity

## Example Analysis:

**Input**: "Today was challenging at work, but I managed to find a creative solution to the problem that's been bothering me for weeks. I realized that instead of getting frustrated, I could approach it from a completely different angle. I'm proud of how I handled the stress and turned it into something productive."

**Output**:

## Data Storage Notes:

The app stores analysis data in the following structure:
- `primary_emotions` → `EmotionalAnalysis.primaryEmotions`
- `emotional_intensity` → `EmotionalAnalysis.emotionalIntensity` (0.0-1.0)
- `growth_indicators` → `EmotionalAnalysis.keyThemes` 
- `entry_insight` → `EmotionalAnalysis.personalizedInsight`
- `core_adjustments` → Used to update personality cores in database
- `mind_reflection` → Processed by UI but not stored directly in database
- `emotional_patterns` → Processed by EmotionalAnalyzer for pattern recognition

Now analyze the following journal entry and provide insights in the exact format specified above.
