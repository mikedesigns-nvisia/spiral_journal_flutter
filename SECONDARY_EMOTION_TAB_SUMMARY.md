## Technical Implementation Details

### Tab Navigation Structure
```dart
Widget _buildTabNavigation() {
  return Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(DesignTokens.spaceM),
    child: Center(
      child: Material(
        color: Colors.transparent,
        child: Container(
          height: 44, // Optimized for touch targets
          decoration: BoxDecoration(
            color: DesignTokens.getBackgroundSecondary(context).withOpacity(0.5),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(DesignTokens.radiusM),
          ),
          child: TabBar(
            // Properly configured TabBar with centered icons
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### Enhanced Widget Parameters
```dart
class PrimaryEmotionalStateWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  final EmotionalState? primaryState;
  final EmotionalState? secondaryState;  // NEW
  final bool showTabs;                   // NEW
  // ... other existing parameters
}
```

### Secondary Emotion Generation

- **Clear Visual Cues**: Star icons clearly indicate primary vs secondary
- **Smooth Interactions**: Responsive tab switching with proper feedback
- **Consistent Behavior**: Follows established UI patterns and conventions

### ✅ **Accessibility Excellence**
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Comprehensive semantic labels and hints
- **Keyboard Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation support
- **High Contrast Support**: Enhanced visibility in high contrast mode
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators and navigation

## Integration with Emotional Mirror Screen

### ✅ **Sample Data Generation**
- **Primary Emotions**: Based on mood balance and emotional variety
- **Secondary Emotions**: Complementary emotions that provide deeper insight
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Different combinations based on user's emotional state

### ✅ **Consistent Design Language**
- **Matches Card System**: Follows the same design patterns as other accessible cards
- **Theme Consistency**: Seamless integration with the overall design system
- **Visual Harmony**: Maintains consistent spacing, colors, and typography

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
