### üéØ Testing Focus for This Build

**Please specifically test these areas:**

1. **Onboarding Persistence**
   - Complete onboarding, then force-quit the app (swipe up and close)
   - Reopen the app - you should go directly to the main screen, NOT back to onboarding
   - Test with fresh app install and existing users

2. **Keyboard Behavior in Journal Entry**
   - Open journal entry screen and start typing
   - Try tapping outside the text field - keyboard should dismiss
   - Try pressing "Done" on keyboard - should dismiss properly
   - Ensure keyboard doesn't persist when navigating between screens

3. **AI Analysis Visibility**
   - Create a new journal entry with some emotional content
   - Save the entry and check journal history
   - Look for AI analysis results/insights appearing in your entries
   - Verify you can see when AI processing is happening

### üì± How to Test the Fixes

1. **For Onboarding**: Delete and reinstall the app, complete onboarding, force-quit, reopen
2. **For Keyboard**: Focus on the journal writing experience and text input areas
3. **For AI Commentary**: Create entries and check if analysis appears in history view

### Known Issues (Still Present)
- Biometric authentication may not work consistently on some devices
- Search functionality may be slower with very large journal collections
