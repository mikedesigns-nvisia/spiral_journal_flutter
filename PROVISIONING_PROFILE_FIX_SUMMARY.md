# Provisioning Profile Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved
Fixed the iOS provisioning profile error that was preventing TestFlight builds:
```
error: Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *" doesn't include the currently selected device "NV-MArce24" (identifier 00006030-001E31681192001C)
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Xcode was trying to build for the Mac device "NV-MArce24" instead of iOS
2. The provisioning profile didn't include this work computer device
3. The device couldn't be registered due to corporate restrictions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Script (`ios/testflight_build.sh`)
**Changed the xcodebuild command to explicitly target iOS:**
```bash
# Before (problematic)
xcodebuild -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner -configuration Release -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive archive

# After (fixed)
xcodebuild -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner -configuration Release -destination generic/platform=iOS -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive archive
```

### 2. Created Test Script (`ios/test_build_fix.sh`)
- Created a verification script to test the fix without full TestFlight upload
- Confirms the build process works with the new iOS destination
- Provides quick feedback on build success

### 3. Cleaned Build Environment
- Removed all cached build artifacts: `rm -rf build/`
- Cleared Xcode derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Runner-*`
- Ran `flutter clean` to ensure fresh dependencies

## Verification Results
✅ **Test build completed successfully**
- Archive creation: ✅ PASSED
- Code signing: ✅ PASSED  
- No provisioning profile errors: ✅ CONFIRMED
- Build targets iOS correctly: ✅ VERIFIED

## Key Technical Details
- **Bundle ID**: `com.mikearce.spiralJournal`
- **Team ID**: `3PH38QP73Z`
- **Signing Identity**: `Apple Development: Michael Arce (FM62RXWK6A)`
- **Provisioning Profile**: `iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *` (6eda24d6-cb85-496b-a96a-920b63f66f43)
- **Build Destination**: `generic/platform=iOS` (instead of specific Mac device)

## Files Modified
1. **`ios/testflight_build.sh`** - Updated xcodebuild command with explicit iOS destination
2. **`ios/test_build_fix.sh`** - New test script for verification (created)

## Next Steps for TestFlight Upload
The provisioning profile issue is now resolved. To upload to TestFlight:

### Option 1: Using Command Line Arguments
```bash
./ios/testflight_build.sh -u YOUR_APPLE_ID -p YOUR_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD
```

### Option 2: Using Environment Variables
```bash
export APPLE_ID="your.email@icloud.com"
export APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"
./ios/testflight_build.sh
```

### Option 3: Using .env File
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
APPLE_ID=your.email@icloud.com
APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
```
Then run:
```bash
./ios/testflight_build.sh
```

## Benefits of This Solution
1. **Device-agnostic**: Works on any Mac without device registration
2. **Standard practice**: Uses the correct approach for App Store builds
3. **Future-proof**: Won't break when switching computers
4. **Corporate-friendly**: No need to register work devices
5. **Automated**: Integrated into existing build pipeline

## Build Process Flow
1. Clean project and dependencies
2. Flutter build for iOS (release, no codesign)
3. Pod install for native dependencies
4. Xcode archive with explicit iOS destination
5. Export archive for App Store distribution
6. Upload to TestFlight via altool

The fix ensures step 4 targets the correct platform, resolving the provisioning profile mismatch.
