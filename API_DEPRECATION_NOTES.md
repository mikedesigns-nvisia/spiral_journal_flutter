# API Deprecation Notes

## withOpacity vs withValues Discrepancy

During the implementation of task 2 "Fix deprecated API usage", I discovered that the task requirements appear to be outdated:

### Current Flutter Status (v3.32.3)
- `withOpacity()` is marked as deprecated
- `withValues()` is the current, preferred API
- Flutter analyzer recommends using `withValues()` to avoid precision loss

### Task Requirements vs Reality
The task required replacing `withValues()` with `withOpacity()`, which is technically moving from the modern API to the deprecated one. However, the task was completed as specified to maintain consistency with the requirements document.

### Recommendation
In a real-world scenario, the requirements should be updated to reflect the current Flutter API recommendations, keeping `withValues()` as the preferred method.

### Files Modified
- `lib/theme/app_theme.dart`
- `lib/widgets/your_cores_card.dart`
- `lib/widgets/mood_selector.dart`
- `lib/screens/core_library_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

All instances of `withValues(alpha: x)` were replaced with `withOpacity(x)` as requested.
