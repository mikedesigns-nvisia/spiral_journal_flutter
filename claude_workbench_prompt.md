## Critical Requirements:

### Percentage Calculations:
- **Range**: 0.0 to 100.0 (use decimals for precision)
- **Realistic Changes**: Adjust by 0.5-3.0 points per entry (small, realistic growth)
- **Evidence-Based**: Only increase cores that are clearly demonstrated in the entry
- **Balanced**: Not every core needs to increase; some may stay stable or slightly decline

### Trend Values:
- **"rising"**: Core showed clear growth or positive development
- **"stable"**: Core maintained current level, no significant change
- **"declining"**: Core showed temporary setback or needs attention

### Insight Quality:
- **Specific**: Reference actual content from the journal entry
- **Encouraging**: Always supportive and growth-focused
- **Actionable**: Provide gentle suggestions when appropriate
- **Personal**: Feel like they're written specifically for this user

### Color and Icon Consistency:
Always use these exact values:
- Optimism: "#FF6B35", "assets/icons/optimism.png"
- Resilience: "#4ECDC4", "assets/icons/resilience.png"
- Self-Awareness: "#45B7D1", "assets/icons/self_awareness.png"
- Creativity: "#96CEB4", "assets/icons/creativity.png"
- Social Connection: "#FFEAA7", "assets/icons/social_connection.png"
- Growth Mindset: "#DDA0DD", "assets/icons/growth_mindset.png"

## Analysis Guidelines:

### Look for Core Indicators:
- **Optimism**: Positive language, hope for future, gratitude, silver linings
- **Resilience**: Overcoming challenges, adapting to change, emotional recovery
- **Self-Awareness**: Emotional recognition, self-reflection, mindfulness
- **Creativity**: Novel solutions, artistic expression, innovative thinking
- **Social Connection**: Relationships, empathy, community involvement
- **Growth Mindset**: Learning from mistakes, embracing challenges, curiosity

### Emotional Analysis:
- **Primary Emotions**: 2-4 main emotions detected (joy, anxiety, contentment, etc.)
- **Intensity**: 0.0-1.0 scale of emotional intensity
- **Themes**: Key topics or patterns in the entry
- **Sentiment**: Overall emotional tone (-1.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is very positive)
