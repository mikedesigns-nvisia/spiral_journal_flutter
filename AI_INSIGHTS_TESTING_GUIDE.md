## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: API Connection Failed
**Symptoms:**
```
❌ API connection test failed: Invalid API key
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check your `.env` file has the correct API key format
2. Verify the API key starts with `sk-ant-api03-`
3. Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the key
4. Test the key directly with Claude's API

### Issue: Analysis Not Stored
**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️  No AI analysis found - may be processing in background
```

**Solutions:**
1. Wait longer for background processing
2. Check if API rate limits are being hit
3. Verify database write permissions
4. Check for network connectivity issues

### Issue: Core Updates Not Working
**Symptoms:**
```
⚠️  No core updates detected - may be using fallback mode
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify AI service is enabled (not in fallback mode)
2. Check if core calculation logic is working
3. Ensure database transactions are completing
4. Verify core mapping configuration

### Issue: UI Data Missing
**Symptoms:**
```
❌ UI data retrieval failed: No entries found
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify journal service initialization
3. Ensure proper data persistence
4. Check for data clearing/reset issues

7. ✅ Search finds entries with AI-detected content

## 🔧 Advanced Debugging

### Enable Detailed Logging
Add this to your app's debug configuration:
```dart
// In your main.dart or debug configuration
debugPrint('AI Analysis Result: $analysisData');
debugPrint('Core Updates: $coreUpdates');
debugPrint('Database Write Status: $writeSuccess');
```

### Monitor API Usage
Track your API calls to ensure you're not hitting rate limits:
- Check API response times
- Monitor error rates
- Track daily usage against limits

### Database Inspection
Verify data is being stored correctly:
```sql
-- Check recent journal entries
SELECT * FROM journal_entries ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check AI analysis data
SELECT id, ai_analysis, is_analyzed FROM journal_entries WHERE ai_analysis IS NOT NULL;

-- Check core updates
SELECT * FROM emotional_cores ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```
